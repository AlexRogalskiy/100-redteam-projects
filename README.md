# 100  Red Team Projects for Pentesters and Network Managers

Red Team Field is one of the most atracting fields in Offensive Security, ever day, professionals and students are learning, creating and exploiting ever type of system. Today where internet is the most common place where people join and chat together, they are exposed in a world where anyone can be monitored, exploited, tracked, or scammed.

This is why we (bugs) programmers take place, many of us try to protect this wonderfull place where others, just do it for kidness. If you're interested in this field, and want to join, no matter's if you dont have any knownledge, learning to create your own tools, will be an great advantage as an pentester. So, i got the ideia to create this project list, for anyone interested to learn 'how to' not become the ultimate script kiddie. Here i wrote (based on my experience) almost 100 type of Projects where you should at least try to make, or just to study.

I recommend to do it, on your less handfull programming language, doing those projects, will help you to master it and gain more experience. They are divided in categories, from super basic, to advanced projects.

If you enjoy it, please take a time to recommend for a friend, and follow me, i will be happy for that :) .
And remember, with great power, comes... (we already know).
